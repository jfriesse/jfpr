The installation of cconv is fairly straight forward.

Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Preparations:

   What you'll need to fully build cconv is ANSI C compiler.
 Building cconv:

   Under Linux you must follow these steps to build the binary:

	1) make
           This will build the binary.  If any problems occur here, send an
	   email detailing the errors to janf@email.cz.

        3) make install
           This will install the binaries and plugins into /usr/bin

	4) cconv
	   Run it and enjoy =)

   If you want tkcconv, install cconv and then
        1) tkcconv
	   Run it and enjoy more =)
